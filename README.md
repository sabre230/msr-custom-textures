# Metroid: Samus Returns Custom Textures
---
This is a small project I'm working on in my free time to update some of the lower quality textures in Metroid: Samus Returns.

These textures were created in the free graphics application Krita. If you want to create your own based on these, I recommend continuing to use Krita to make adjustments.
